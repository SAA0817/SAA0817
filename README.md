## Research on Optimization and Problem Reduction of Network Maximum Flow Algorithms

**Project Overview:**  
This project delves into the network maximum flow problem, a pivotal combinatorial optimization challenge in graph theory. It begins by establishing the fundamental symbols and definitions of the maximum flow problem and then categorizes existing methods into two main approaches: **augmenting path algorithms** and **preflow-push algorithms**.

For the augmenting path approaches, the project introduces the EK/Dinic algorithms and their optimizations, along with the MPM/ISAP variants and a comparative performance analysis. For preflow-push approaches, it focuses on analyzing the characteristics of the HLPP algorithm and proposes an improved Budget Algorithm to mitigate the "ping-pong effect", validated through extensive comparative experiments.

Additionally, the project summarizes four common problem reduction paradigms:
- Bipartite Graph Maximum Matching
- Minimum-Cost Maximum Flow
- Bipartite Graph Maximum Weight Matching
- Minimum Cut Problem

All implementations are done in C++ with comprehensive testing, making the project a valuable resource for both theoretical research and practical applications.

**Tech Stack:**
- C++  
- Algorithm Optimization & Performance Testing
